abstract: Archetypes are those extreme values of a data set that can jointly represent
  all other data points. They often have descriptive meanings and can thus contribute
  to the understanding of the data. Such archetypes are identified using archetypal
  analysis and all data points are represented as convex combinations thereof. In
  this work, archetypal analysis is linked with quantum annealing. For both steps,
  i.e. the determination of archetypes and the assignment of data points, we derive
  a QUBO formulation which is solved on D-Waveâ€™s 2000Q Quantum Annealer. For selected
  data sets, called toy and iris, our quantum annealing-based approach can achieve
  similar results to the original R-package archetypes.
