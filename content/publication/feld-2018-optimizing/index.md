abstract: The compression of geometry data is an important aspect of bandwidth-efficient
  data transfer for distributed 3d computer vision applications. We propose a quantum-enabled
  lossy 3d point cloud compression pipeline based on the constructive solid geometry
  (CSG) model representation. Key parts of the pipeline are mapped to NP-complete
  problems for which an efficient Ising formulation suitable for the execution on
  a Quantum Annealer exists. We describe existing Ising formulations for the maximum
  clique search problem and the smallest exact cover problem, both of which are important
  building blocks of the proposed compression pipeline. Additionally, we discuss the
  properties of the overall pipeline regarding result optimality and described Ising
  formulations.
