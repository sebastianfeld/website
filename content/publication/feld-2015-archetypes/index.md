abstract: Alternative routes have found many applications in navigation scenarios.
  However, alternative routes have only been introduced recently for the indoor space
  due to the complexity of these environments. Furthermore, the number of alternative
  routes in buildings can be quite high. With this paper, we propose to organize sets
  of alternative routes by employing archetypal analysis on a feature space representation
  of routes and show results in which a set of hundreds of routes between the same
  start and end point has been compressed to only a few obviously different archetypal
  routes. Additionally, the framework allows for comparing routes with archetypes
  and with each other. This comparison does not reveal spatial similarity alone, but
  rather a measure of routes' similarity representing their inherent semantic character.
