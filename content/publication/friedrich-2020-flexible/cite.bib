 abstract = {Construction trees are an intuitive, yet powerful technique for the representation of geometry using a combination of Boolean set-operations and geometric primitives. In general, there exist an infinite number of trees all describing the same 3D solid. However, some trees are optimal regarding the number of used operations, their shape or other attributes, like their suitability for intuitive, human-controlled editing. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of newly developed, as well, as already existing tree optimization methods and propose a flexible and scalable processing pipeline consisting of the aforementioned techniques with a focus on tree editability. In addition, we introduce a new quantitative measure for construction tree editability and show how it can be used as a constraint in the optimization process.},
