abstract: Indoor location-based services is an ever emerging field of research and
  application. In particular indoor navigation, i.e. positioning and route planning
  in freely walkable space, gets much attention. The philosophy of this paper is to
  incorporate isovists as a numerical representation of the local environment to enable
  new types of indoor LBS. This paper has got two main contributions. First, we define
  discrete isovists as an approximation of exact isovists using a simple ray casting
  approach. Second, we define, create, and use isovist feature cubes for semantic
  evaluations of floor plans as well as trajectory annotation.
