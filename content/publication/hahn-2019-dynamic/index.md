abstract: 'This paper considers the problem of path planning under dynamic aspects.
  We propose Neural Gas Dynamic Path Planning (NGDPP), a novel algorithm that continuously
  provides a valid path between two points inside an environment that transforms in
  an unpredictable manner. These transformations can occur due to both, changes in
  the environmentâ€™s shape and moving collision objects. The algorithm incorporates
  several techniques: Neural Gas, a dynamic discretization method; the A* Algorithm,
  a path planning algorithm for graphs; and the Potential Field method, which facilitates
  the avoidance of collisions. We empirically evaluate the proposed algorithm under
  various aspects providing performance information and guidance about situations
  and applications benefiting from the algorithm. The evaluation reveals that NGDPP
  is a solid algorithm for path planning in dynamic environments. Yet, the algorithm
  is based on heuristic information, i.e. a optimal result in term of the path length
  cannot be guaranteed.'
