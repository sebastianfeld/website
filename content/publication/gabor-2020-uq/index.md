abstract: Quantum Annealing is an algorithm for solving instances of quadratic unconstrained
  binary optimization (QUBO) that is implemented in hardware utilizing quantum effects
  to quickly find approximate solutions. However, QUBO can obviously also be solved
  by any classical optimization technique, for which various implementations exist.
  The UQ platform provides a unified interface to various means of solving QUBO that
  allows for a seamless switch between classical and quantum methods while implementing
  features such as load and user management.
