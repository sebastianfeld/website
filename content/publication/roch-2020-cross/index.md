abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization
  Algorithm (QAOA) are considered as one of the most encouraging approaches for taking
  advantage of near-term quantum computers in practical applications. Such algorithms
  are usually implemented in a variational form, combining a classical optimization
  method with a quantum machine to find good solutions to an optimization problem.
  The solution quality of QAOA depends to a high degree on the parameters chosen by
  the classical optimizer at each iteration. However, the solution landscape of those
  parameters is highly multi-dimensional and contains many low-quality local optima.
  In this study we apply a Cross-Entropy method to shape this landscape, which allows
  the classical optimizer to find better parameter more easily and hence results in
  an improved performance. We empirically demonstrate that this approach can reach
  a significant better solution quality for the Knapsack Problem.
