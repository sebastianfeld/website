abstract: Nowadays indoor navigation and the understanding of indoor maps and floor
  plans are becoming increasingly important fields of research and application. This
  paper introduces clustering of floor plan areas of buildings according to different
  characteristics. These characteristics consist of computed human perception of space,
  namely isovist features. Based on the calculated isovist features of floorplans
  we can show the possible existence of greatly varying alternative routes inside
  and around buildings. These routes are archetypes, since they are products of archetypal
  analysis, a fuzzy clustering method that allows the identification of observations
  with extreme values. Besides archetypal routes in a building we derive floor plan
  area archetypes. This has the intention of gaining more knowledge on how parts of
  selected indoor environments are perceived by humans. Finally, our approach helps
  to find a connection between subjective human perceptions and defined functional
  spaces in indoor environments.
