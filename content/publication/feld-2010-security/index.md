abstract: OpenID is an open, decentralized and URL-based standard for Single Sign-On
  (SSO) on the Internet. In addition, the new electronic identity card (“Neuer Personalausweis”,
  nPA) will be introduced in Germany in November 2010. This work shows the problems
  associated with OpenID and addresses possible solutions. There is also a discussion
  on how to improve the OpenID protocol by the combination of the nPA respectively
  the Restricted Identification (RI) with an OpenID identity. The concept of an OpenID
  provider with nPA support will be presented together with its precondition. The
  added value created by the combination of the two technologies nPA and OpenID in
  different directions is discussed.
