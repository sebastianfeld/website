abstract: Encoding multimedia streams of video calls is a very compute-intense task
  that significantly decreases battery lifetime of mobile phones. This paper introduces
  an approach to reduce power consumption of mobile phones by offloading video encoding
  efforts from mobile devices to external services. These services are hosted on servers
  co-located with cellular base stations. The paper describes how these services are
  integrated into the existing mobile network architecture and presents a communication
  protocol for negotiating offloading settings. First measurement results indicate
  that power consumption of mobile devices is reduced by approximately 13%.
