abstract: Mobile Edge Computing proposes co-locating com-puting and storage resources
  at base stations of cellular networks. It is seen as a promising technique to alleviate
  utilization of the mobile core and to reduce latency for mobile end users. Due to
  the fact that Mobile Edge Computing is a novel approach not yet deployed in real-life
  networks, recent work discusses merely general and non-technical ideas and concepts.
  This paper introduces a taxonomy for Mobile Edge Computing applications and analyzes
  chances and limitations from a technical point of view. Application types which
  profit from edge deployment are identified and discussed. Furthermore, these applications
  are systematically classified based on technical metrics.
