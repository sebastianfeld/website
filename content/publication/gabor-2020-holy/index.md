abstract: 'We discuss the synergetic connection between quantum computing and artificial
  intelligence. After surveying current approaches to quantum artificial intelligence
  and relating them to a formal model for machine learning processes, we deduce four
  major challenges for the future of quantum artificial intelligence: (i) Replace
  iterative training with faster quantum algorithms, (ii) distill the experience of
  larger amounts of data into the training process, (iii) allow quantum and classical
  components to be easily combined and exchanged, and (iv) build tools to thoroughly
  analyze if observed benefits really stem from quantum properties of the algorithm.'
