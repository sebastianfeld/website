abstract: Fully autonomously driving vehicles are expected to be a widely available
  technology in the near future. Privately owned cars, which remain parked for the
  majority of their lifetime, may therefore be capable of driving independently during
  their usual long parking periods (e.g. their owners working hours). Our analysis
  aims to focus on the potential of a privately owned shared car concept as transition
  period between the present usages of privately owned cars towards a transportation
  paradigm of privately owned shared autonomous vehicles. We propose two methods in
  the field of reachability analysis to evaluate the impact of such vehicles during
  parking periods. Our proposed methods are applied to a dataset of parking times
  of users of a telematics service provider in the Munich area (Germany). We show
  the impact of time and location dependent effects on the analyzed service coverage,
  such as business week rush hours or coverage divergence between urban and suburban
  regions.
