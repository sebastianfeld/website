abstract: Lots of existing work addresses the analysis of Bitcoin's publicly available
  transaction graph. There are evaluations of the user's anonymity and privacy, but
  no proper measurements of the underlying network. This paper presents novel insights
  about Bitcoin's P2P network, with a focus on the distribution among autonomous systems.
  The resilience of Bitcoin's ecosystem, the unambiguousness of the blockchain, the
  propagation and verification of transaction blocks, but also the anonymity of Bitcoin's
  users depend on the structure of the global network. Our work is the first thorough
  analysis of Bitcoin's underlying network, especially with regard to its distribution
  at autonomous system level. We traversed Bitcoin's network and made statements about
  the size of the accessible network and the number of clients. Further, we investigated
  the network's distribution on autonomous systems. Finally, we analysed the mechanism
  to announce known peers. It turns out that Bitcoin's peer announcement is not well-distributed,
  affecting information propagation.
