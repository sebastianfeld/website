abstract: Nowadays, software systems and applications need to adapt rapidly to changing
  requirements and evolve in an agile manner. This creates the need for independent
  deployments, e.g. as part of DevOps. Due to the flexibility and fast release cycles
  comprised by DevOps, continuous monitoring and the generation of feedback is crucial
  to a systemâ€™s quality, especially if it is continuously developed. For this purpose,
  we propose a feedback system that combines operations data with development data
  in order to trace anomalies occurring in production back to their root cause by
  defining patterns, detecting anomalous behavior, and generating feedback that is
  transferred back into the development process. To this end, we utilize two different
  unsupervised machine learning techniques, the k-means clustering and the archetypal
  analysis, to describe the data set and use the results as a basis to characterize
  the behavior of new data points as either normal or anomalous. The feedback system
  was tested and evaluated using real data produced by an application that is currently
  developed within a large, industrial company and serves as a link to support the
  loop of continuous planning, development, deployment, monitoring, and feedback.
