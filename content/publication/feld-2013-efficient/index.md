abstract: This paper investigates a complication of the classical Traveling Salesman
  Problem, which arises due to multiple points of interest with functional equivalence.
  While the classical Traveling Salesman Problem tries to find a shortest tour visiting
  each point in a set exactly once, we consider the challenge of finding the shortest
  tour visiting each point of a given set exactly once and exactly one additional
  point out of a different set of equivalent places. The insertion of a gas station
  to a traveling salesman problem provides an example. With this paper, we investigate
  and analyze different algorithms to solve this complex problem by reducing it to
  the solution of a set of classic Traveling Salesman Problems. Furthermore, we provide
  an efficient tradeoff between the size of the set of traditional problems still
  to be solved and the expected error of the algorithm.
