abstract: In various settings in nature or robotics, swarms offer various benefits
  as a structure that can be joined easily and locally but still offers more resilience
  or efficiency at performing certain tasks. When these benefits are rewarded accordingly,
  even purely self-interested multi-agent reinforcement learning systems will thus
  learn to form swarms for each individual’s benefit. In this work we show, however,
  that under certain conditions swarms also pose Nash equilibria when interpreting
  the agents’ given task as multi-player game. We show that these conditions can be
  achieved by altering the area size (while allowing individual action choices) in
  a setting known from literature. We conclude that aside from offering valuable benefits
  to rational agents, swarms may also form due to pressuring deviants from swarming
  behavior into joining the swarm as is typical for Nash equilibria in social dilemmas.
