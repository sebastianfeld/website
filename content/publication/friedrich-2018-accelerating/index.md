abstract: Extracting a Construction Tree from potentially noisy point clouds is an
  important aspect of Reverse Engineering tasks in Computer Aided Design. Solutions
  based on algorithmic geometry impose constraints on usable model representations
  (e.g. quadric surfaces only) and noise robustness. Re-formulating the problem as
  a combinatorial optimization problem and solving it with an Evolutionary Algorithm
  can mitigate some of these constraints at the cost of increased computational complexity.
  This paper proposes a graph-based search space partitioning scheme that is able
  to accelerate Evolutionary Construction Tree extraction while exploiting parallelization
  capabilities of modern CPUs. The evaluation indicates a speed-up up to a factor
  of 46.6 compared to the baseline approach while resulting tree sizes increased by
  25.2% to 88.6%.
