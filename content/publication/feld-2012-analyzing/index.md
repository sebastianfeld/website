abstract: Several thousands of interconnected autonomous systems form the Internet,
  which is regarded as the most powerful communication infrastructure today. Measuring
  the network and monitoring its vital parameters is crucial for securing continuous
  availability and steady performance of the Internet. This paper introduces AS-Analyzer,
  a tool for gathering and analyzing data related to autonomous systems and their
  interconnection. Using AS-Analyzer’s modules for collecting data from different
  sources, calculating key figures and creating reports, we present a vivid example
  by analyzing the G-20’s key autonomous systems and their intermeshing. A brief discussion
  of key figures related to autonomous system, IPv4 addresses, connections, categories
  and malware will complete the presentation.
