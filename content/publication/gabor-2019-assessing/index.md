abstract: When solving propositional logic satisfiability (specifically 3SAT) using
  quantum annealing, we analyze the effect the difficulty of different instances of
  the problem has on the quality of the answer returned by the quantum annealer. A
  high-quality response from the annealer in this case is defined by a high percentage
  of correct solutions among the returned answers. We show that the phase transition
  regarding the computational complexity of the problem, which is well-known to occur
  for 3SAT on classical machines (where it causes a detrimental increase in runtime),
  persists in some form (but possibly to a lesser extent) for quantum annealing.
