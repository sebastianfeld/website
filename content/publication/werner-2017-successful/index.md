abstract: Currently, we experience a growing number of highly sophisticated digital
  services in virtually every domain of our lives. Tightly coupled to this observation
  is the appearance of Big Data and consequently the need for Data Science. When trying
  to transform data into value, communication is key. However, communication can easily
  get ambiguous and may threat success by misunderstandings. Thus, this article reviews
  the (communication) model of Data Science and maps the ten Vâ€™s of Big Data to this
  model. Finally, we propose four top skills that each and every data science group
  needs to have to operate successfully.
