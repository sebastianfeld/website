abstract: 'Human perception of location and space forms the basis upon which the interaction
  with location-based services (LBS) takes place. Our work aims to develop a shared
  awareness and common understanding of location and space,between machines and their
  users by building upon research into the numerical representation of the visual
  perception of space. Different structures in buildings like rooms, hallways and
  doorways form different, corresponding patterns in these representations. Thanks
  to recent advances in the field of deep learning with neural networks, it now seems
  possible to explore the idea of automatically learning these recurring structures.
  This article presents a complete framework: starting from the collection of isovist
  measures along geospatial trajectories on indoor floor plans,over statistical data
  analysis, the unsupervised extraction of meaningful structure, up to the training
  of models that generalize to different environments. We show that isovist measures
  do reflect the recurring structures found in different buildings, that these recurring
  patterns are encoded in the data in a way that unsupervised machine learning can
  identify them andthat the identified structures are meaningful as they represent
  human relatable concepts.Furthermore, we propose to use cluster similarity analysis
  as a promising concept for quantifying visual perception similarity.'
