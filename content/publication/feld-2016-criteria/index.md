abstract: Recently, alternative routes have gained momentum in the creation of Location-Based
  Services. This paper gathers and sorts existing work regarding quality metrics of
  alternative routes and alternative graphs in road networks and discusses their commonalities.
  Based on this, the paper clarifies what challenges need to be tackled in order to
  create such metrics for constrained free space scenarios and discusses possible
  courses of action, opportunities, and limitations. The general goal of this paper
  is to stimulate the discussion on and the development of quality metrics for alternative
  routes and alternative graphs for constrained free spaces like pedestrian navigation,
  or even maritime or aviation scenarios.
