 abstract = {Recently, alternative routes have gained momentum in the creation of Location-Based Services. This paper gathers and sorts existing work regarding quality metrics of alternative routes and alternative graphs in road networks and discusses their commonalities. Based on this, the paper clarifies what challenges need to be tackled in order to create such metrics for constrained free space scenarios and discusses possible courses of action, opportunities, and limitations. The general goal of this paper is to stimulate the discussion on and the development of quality metrics for alternative routes and alternative graphs for constrained free spaces like pedestrian navigation, or even maritime or aviation scenarios.},
