abstract: In the near future, more and more machines will perform tasks in the vicinity
  of human spaces or support them directly in their spatially bound activities. In
  order to simplify the verbal communication and the interaction between robotic units
  and/or humans, reliable and robust systems w.r.t. noise and processing results are
  needed. This work builds a foundation to address this task. By using a continuous
  representation of spatial perception in interiors learned from trajectory data,
  our approach clusters movement in dependency to its spatial context. We propose
  an unsupervised learning approach based on a neural autoencoding that learns semantically
  meaningful continuous encodings of spatio-temporal trajectory data. This learned
  encoding can be used to form prototypical representations. We present promising
  results that clear the path for future applications.
