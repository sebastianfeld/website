abstract: Autonomous mobile robots show promising opportunities as concrete use cases
  of location-based services. Such robots are able to perform various tasks in buildings
  using a wide array of sensors to perceive their surroundings. A connected area of
  research which forms the basis for a deeper understanding of these perceptions is
  the numerical representation of visual perception of space. Different structures
  in buildings like rooms, hallways and doorways form different, corresponding patterns
  in these representations. Thanks to recent advances in the field of deep learning
  with neural networks, it now seems possible to explore the idea of automatically
  learning these recurring structures using machine learning techniques. Combining
  these topics will enable the creation of new and better location-based services
  which have a deep awareness of their surroundings. This paper presents a framework
  to create a data set containing 2D isovist measures calculated along geospatial
  trajectories that traverse a 3D simulation environment. Furthermore, we show that
  these isovist measures do reflect the recurring structures found in buildings and
  the recurring patterns are encoded in a way that unsupervised machine learning is
  able to identify meaningful structures like rooms, hallways and doorways. These
  labeled data sets can further be used for neural network based supervised learning.
  The models generated this way do generalize and are able to identify structures
  in different environments.
