 abstract = {The progress in developing quantum hardware with functional quantum processors integrating tens of noisy qubits, together with the availability of near-term quantum algorithms has led to the release of the first quantum computers. These quantum computing systems already integrate different software and hardware components of the so-called "full-stack", bridging quantum applications to quantum devices. In this paper, we will provide an overview on current full-stack quantum computing systems. We will emphasize the need for tight co-design among adjacent layers as well as vertical cross-layer design to extract the most from noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors which are both error-prone and severely constrained in resources. As an example of co-design, we will focus on the development of hardware-aware and algorithm-driven compilation techniques.},
