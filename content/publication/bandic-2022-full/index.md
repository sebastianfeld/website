abstract: The progress in developing quantum hardware with functional quantum processors
  integrating tens of noisy qubits, together with the availability of near-term quantum
  algorithms has led to the release of the first quantum computers. These quantum
  computing systems already integrate different software and hardware components of
  the so-called \"full-stack\", bridging quantum applications to quantum devices.
  In this paper, we will provide an overview on current full-stack quantum computing
  systems. We will emphasize the need for tight co-design among adjacent layers as
  well as vertical cross-layer design to extract the most from noisy intermediate-scale
  quantum (NISQ) processors which are both error-prone and severely constrained in
  resources. As an example of co-design, we will focus on the development of hardware-aware
  and algorithm-driven compilation techniques.
