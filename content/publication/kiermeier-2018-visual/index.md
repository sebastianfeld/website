abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) is a central task for quality assurance in manufacturing
  plants. By tracing back anomalies to its actual trigger, recurrent misbehavior can
  be eliminated, which improves the system's future performance. In self-organizing
  industrial systems (SOIS), however, where the system adapts its behavior to the
  current circumstances and requests, new challenges arise for RCA. For example, the
  system decides dynamically at runtime how to route the work-pieces through the factory.
  This high degree of freedom of the system causes a state space explosion, which
  makes it difficult to formalize explicit connections. In addition, there are new
  dependency relationships resulting from the online decision making process and its
  influencing factors, which have to be taken into account for RCA. Accordingly, in
  this paper, we present first of all a taxonomy of possible root causes in such SOIS.
  Thereby, we focus in particular on possible error sources resulting from the online
  decision making process. Based on this, corresponding backtracking approaches are
  presented, whereby automatable and non-automatable procedures are distinguished.
  The latter becomes relevant in case that a component of the online decision making
  system is not evaluable automatably due to the state space explosion. To trace back
  anomalies anyway, we propose here a visual analytics solution. A corresponding proof
  of concept which implements the necessary functions for an expert-based assessment
  is presented in this paper.
