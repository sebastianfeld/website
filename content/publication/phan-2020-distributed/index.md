abstract: We propose Stable Emergent Policy (STEP) approximation, a distributed policy
  iteration scheme to stably approximate decentralized policies for partially observable
  and cooperative multi-agent systems. STEP offers a novel training architecture,
  where function approximation is used to learn from action recommendations of a decentralized
  planning algorithm. Planning is enabled by exploiting a training simulator, which
  is assumed to be available during centralized learning, and further enhanced by
  reintegrating the learned policies. We experimentally evaluate STEP in two challenging
  and stochastic domains, and compare its performance with state-of-the-art multi-agent
  reinforcement learning algorithms.
