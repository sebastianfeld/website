abstract: 'The Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) describes the problem, of finding a stable
  matching between two equally sized sets of elements (e.g., males and females) given
  an ordering of preferences for each element. A matching is stable, when there does
  not exist any match of a male and female which both prefer each other to their current
  partner under the matching. Finding such a matching of maximum cardinality, when
  ties and incomplete preference lists are allowed, is called MAX-SMTI and is an NP-hard
  variation of the SMP. In this work a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
  (QUBO) formulation for MAX-SMTI is introduced and solved both with D-Wave Systems
  quantum annealing hardware and by their classical meta-heuristic QBSolv. Both approaches
  are reviewed against existing state-of-the-art approximation algorithms for MAX-SMTI.
  Additionally, the proposed QUBO problem can also be used to count stable matchings
  in SMP instances, which is proven to be a #P-complete problem. The results show,
  that the proposed (quantum) methods can compete with the classical ones regarding
  the solution quality and might be a relevant alternative, when quantum hardware
  scales with respect to the number of qubits and their connectivity.'
