abstract: We introduce Q-Nash, a quantum annealing algorithm for the NP-complete problem
  of finding pure Nash equilibria in graphical games. The algorithm consists of two
  phases. The first phase determines all combinations of best response strategies
  for each player using classical computation. The second phase finds pure Nash equilibria
  using a quantum annealing device by mapping the computed combinations to a quadratic
  unconstrained binary optimization formulation based on the Set Cover problem. We
  empirically evaluate Q-Nash on D-Wave’s Quantum Annealer 2000Q using different graphical
  game topologies. The results with respect to solution quality and computing time
  are compared to a Brute Force algorithm and the Iterated Best Response heuristic.
