abstract: 'With the ongoing rise of smartphones as everyday mobile devices and their
  steadily increasing amount of sensing and communication capabilities, we are on
  the brink of a subtle, widespread adoption of context-aware computing techniques
  into our daily lives. Focusing on functionality and performance, the majority of
  existing architectures for managing context information typically deploy central
  components for collecting, analyzing and distributing its users’ up-to-date data.
  However, preservation of users’ privacy needs remains a crucial factor for such
  systems’ acceptableness. Inspired by existing works on privacy in context-aware
  applications and the authors’ beliefs in the necessity to put users back in control,
  this article adopts a privacy-centric perspective and presents ALPACA: A novel approach
  for modeling and managing a user’s rich context information in a user-centric and
  privacy-preserving way fit for a multitude of different usage scenarios. To this
  end, this article offers a general conceptual mapping of a user’s privacy needs
  to distinct layers. Based on this conceptualization we introduce a privacy-centric
  approach for modeling this information. Additionally, we propose a context-aware
  mechanism for the definition of context-dependent release triggers in order to enable
  fine-grained control over the disclosure of sensitive information. Finally, we present
  the components of the proposed system architecture, explain how they interact with
  each other and discuss how our framework can be integrated into a modern mobile
  operating system.'
