abstract: Many problems of industrial interest are NP-complete, and quickly exhaust
  resources of computational devices with increasing input sizes. Quantum annealers
  (QA) are physical devices that aim at this class of problems by exploiting quantum
  mechanical properties of nature. However, they compete with efficient heuristics
  and probabilistic or randomised algorithms on classical machines that allow for
  finding approximate solutions to large NP-complete problems. While first implementations
  of QA have become commercially available, their practical benefits are far from
  fully explored. To the best of our knowledge, approximation techniques have not
  yet received substantial attention. In this paper, we explore how problemsâ€™ approximate
  versions of varying degree can be systematically constructed for quantum annealer
  programs, and how this influences result quality or the handling of larger problem
  instances on given set of qubits. We illustrate various approximation techniques
  on both, simulations and real QA hardware, on different seminal problems, and interpret
  the results to contribute towards a better understanding of the real-world power
  and limitations of current-state and future quantum computing.
