abstract: With this paper, we propose a novel semantic compression scheme for GPS
  trajectories which exploits map knowledge for data reduction. Therefore, the compression
  is integrated into a simple map matching scheme and shows superior performance with
  respect to the compression ratio. In contrast to other compression schemes including
  compressed GPX files, a lot of information about a trajectory can be readily extracted
  from the given representation and a uniformly sampled representative can be easily
  calculated for advanced trajectory comparison. We provide a detailed analysis of
  the approach as well as preliminary results on performance and feasibility of this
  approach in typical urban mobility scenarios.
