 abstract = {With this paper, we propose a novel semantic compression scheme for GPS trajectories which exploits map knowledge for data reduction. Therefore, the compression is integrated into a simple map matching scheme and shows superior performance with respect to the compression ratio. In contrast to other compression schemes including compressed GPX files, a lot of information about a trajectory can be readily extracted from the given representation and a uniformly sampled representative can be easily calculated for advanced trajectory comparison. We provide a detailed analysis of the approach as well as preliminary results on performance and feasibility of this approach in typical urban mobility scenarios.},
