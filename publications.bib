abstract = {Das Buch zeigt verschiedene Ansätze und Verfahren, um alternative Routen in Freiflächen zu berechnen, geospatiale Trajektorien zu vergleichen sowie Strukturen in Gebäuden zu identifizieren. Die Wegefindung in komplexen Umgebungen unterscheidet sich von der in Straßennetzen vor allem dadurch, dass sich eine Person nahezu in alle Richtungen bewegen kann. Das Vorhalten von alternativen Routen für Fußgänger (aber auch für mobile Roboter) in Flughäfen, Krankenhäusern, Messehallen, Parks, Industrieanlagen oder Lagerhallen ermöglicht beispielsweise eine personalisierte Navigation, sodass proaktiv Stau vermieden oder blockierten Bereichen ausgewichen wird. Im ersten Teil des Buches definiert der Autor alternative Routen in komplexen Umgebungen, stellt den Algorithmus zum Berechnen solcher Routen vor und geht auf Qualitätsmetriken sowie Alternativgraphen ein. Im zweiten Teil legt Sebastian Feld unter anderem ein System zum Vergleich von Routen vor, mit dem aus einer Menge von Routen die extremsten Exemplare extrahiert werden können. Schließlich integriert er im dritten Teil des Buches die quantitative Analyse der visuellen Wahrnehmung von Raum in den Kontext alternativer Routen. Damit bietet das Buch einen Werkzeugkasten, der von weiteren ortsbezogenen Anwendungen und Diensten verwendet werden kann.},

doi={10.1109/TQE.2022.3160015},
abstract = {The qubit-mapping problem aims to assign and route qubits of a quantum circuit onto an noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device in an optimized fashion, with respect to some cost function. Finding an optimal solution to this problem is known to scale exponentially in computational complexity; as such, it is imperative to investigate scalable qubit-mapping solutions for NISQ computation. In this work, a noise-aware heuristic qubit-assignment algorithm (which assigns initial placements for qubits in a quantum algorithm to qubits on an NISQ device, but does not route qubits during the quantum algorithm's execution) is presented and compared against the optimal brute-force solution, as well as a trivial qubit assignment, with the aim to quantify the performance of our heuristic qubit-assignment algorithm. We find that for small, connected-graph algorithms, our heuristic-assignment algorithm faithfully lies in between the effective upper and lower bounds given by the brute-force and trivial qubit-assignment algorithms. Additionally, we find that the topological-graph properties of quantum algorithms with over six qubits play an important role in our heuristic qubit-assignment algorithm's performance on NISQ devices. Finally, we investigate the scaling properties of our heuristic algorithm for quantum processors with up to 100 qubits; here, the algorithm was found to be scalable for quantum-algorithms that admit path-like graphs. Our findings show that as the size of the quantum processor in our simulation grows, so do the benefits from utilizing the heuristic qubitassignment algorithm, under particular constraints for our heuristic algorithm. This work, thus, characterizes the performance of a heuristic qubit-assignment algorithm with respect to the topological-graph and scaling properties of a quantum algorithm that one may wish to run on a given NISQ device.},

abstract = {The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is an NP-optimization problem (NPO) that has been of great interest for decades for both, science and industry. The CVRP is a variant of the vehicle routing problem characterized by capacity constrained vehicles. The aim is to plan tours for vehicles to supply a given number of customers as efficiently as possible. The problem is the combinatorial explosion of possible solutions, which increases superexponentially with the number of customers. Classical solutions provide good approximations to the globally optimal solution. D-Wave's quantum annealer is a machine designed to solve optimization problems. This machine uses quantum effects to speed up computation time compared to classic computers. The problem on solving the CVRP on the quantum annealer is the particular formulation of the optimization problem. For this, it has to be mapped onto a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Complex optimization problems such as the CVRP can be translated to smaller subproblems and thus enable a sequential solution of the partitioned problem. This work presents a quantum-classic hybrid solution method for the CVRP. It clarifies whether the implementation of such a method pays off in comparison to existing classical solution methods regarding computation time and solution quality. Several approaches to solving the CVRP are elaborated, the arising problems are discussed, and the results are evaluated in terms of solution quality and computation time.},

Our work aims to develop a shared awareness and common understanding of location and space,between machines and their users by building upon research into the numerical representation of the visual perception of space. Different structures in buildings like rooms, hallways and doorways form different, corresponding patterns in these representations. Thanks to recent advances in the field of deep learning with neural networks, it now seems possible to explore the idea of automatically learning these recurring structures. This article presents a complete framework: starting from the collection of isovist measures along geospatial trajectories on indoor floor plans,over statistical data analysis, the unsupervised extraction of meaningful structure, up to the training of models that generalize to different environments. We show that isovist measures do reflect the recurring structures found in different buildings, that these recurring patterns are encoded in the data in a way that unsupervised machine learning can identify them andthat the identified structures are meaningful as they represent human relatable concepts.Furthermore, we propose to use cluster similarity analysis as a promising concept for quantifying visual perception similarity.},

The resilience of Bitcoin's ecosystem, the unambiguousness of the blockchain, the propagation and verification of transaction blocks, but also the anonymity of Bitcoin's users depend on the structure of the global network. Our work is the first thorough analysis of Bitcoin's underlying network, especially with regard to its distribution at autonomous system level. We traversed Bitcoin's network and made statements about the size of the accessible network and the number of clients. Further, we investigated the network's distribution on autonomous systems. Finally, we analysed the mechanism to announce known peers. It turns out that Bitcoin's peer announcement is not well-distributed, affecting information propagation.},

abstract = {With the ongoing rise of smartphones as everyday mobile devices and their steadily increasing amount of sensing and communication capabilities, we are on the brink of a subtle, widespread adoption of context-aware computing techniques into our daily lives. Focusing on functionality and performance, the majority of existing architectures for managing context information typically deploy central components for collecting, analyzing and distributing its users’ up-to-date data. However, preservation of users’ privacy needs remains a crucial factor for such systems’ acceptableness. Inspired by existing works on privacy in context-aware applications and the authors’ beliefs in the necessity to put users back in control, this article adopts a privacy-centric perspective and presents ALPACA: A novel approach for modeling and managing a user’s rich context information in a user-centric and privacy-preserving way fit for a multitude of different usage scenarios. To this end, this article offers a general conceptual mapping of a user’s privacy needs to distinct layers. Based on this conceptualization we introduce a privacy-centric approach for modeling this information. Additionally, we propose a context-aware mechanism for the definition of context-dependent release triggers in order to enable fine-grained control over the disclosure of sensitive information. Finally, we present the components of the proposed system architecture, explain how they interact with each other and discuss how our framework can be integrated into a modern mobile operating system.},

QUBOs attract particular attention since they can be solved with quantum hardware, like quantum annealers or quantum gate computers running QAOA. In this paper, we present two novel QUBO formulations for k-SAT and Hamiltonian Cycles that scale significantly better than existing approaches. For k-SAT we reduce the growth of the QUBO matrix from O(k) to O(log(k)). For Hamiltonian Cycles the matrix no longer grows quadratically in the number of nodes, as currently, but linearly in the number of edges and logarithmically in the number of nodes. We present these two formulations not as mathematical expressions, as most QUBO formulations are, but as meta-algorithms that facilitate the design of more complex QUBO formulations and allow easy reuse in larger and more complex QUBO formulations.},

A matching is stable, when there does not exist any match of a male and female which both prefer each other to their current partner under the matching. Finding such a matching of maximum cardinality, when ties and incomplete preference lists are allowed, is called MAX-SMTI and is an NP-hard variation of the SMP. In this work a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation for MAX-SMTI is introduced and solved both with D-Wave Systems quantum annealing hardware and by their classical meta-heuristic QBSolv. Both approaches are reviewed against existing state-of-the-art approximation algorithms for MAX-SMTI. Additionally, the proposed QUBO problem can also be used to count stable matchings in SMP instances, which is proven to be a #P-complete problem. The results show, that the proposed (quantum) methods can compete with the classical ones regarding the solution quality and might be a relevant alternative, when quantum hardware scales with respect to the number of qubits and their connectivity.},

Such algorithms are usually implemented in a variational form, combining a classical optimization method with a quantum machine to find good solutions to an optimization problem. The solution quality of QAOA depends to a high degree on the parameters chosen by the classical optimizer at each iteration. However, the solution landscape of those parameters is highly multi-dimensional and contains many low-quality local optima. In this study we apply a Cross-Entropy method to shape this landscape, which allows the classical optimizer to find better parameter more easily and hence results in an improved performance. We empirically demonstrate that this approach can reach a significant better solution quality for the Knapsack Problem.},

abstract = {Autonomous agents such as self-driving cars or parcel robots need to recognize and avoid possible collisions with obstacles in order to move successfully in their environment. Humans, however, have learned to predict movements intuitively and to avoid obstacles in a forward-looking way. The task of collision avoidance can be divided into a global and a local level. Regarding the global level, we propose an approach called "Predictive Collision Management Path Planning" (PCMP). At the local level, solutions for collision avoidance are used that prevent an inevitable collision. Therefore, the aim of PCMP is to avoid unnecessary local collision scenarios using predictive collision management. PCMP is a graph-based algorithm with a focus on the time dimension consisting of three parts: (1) movement prediction, (2) integration of movement prediction into a time-dependent graph, and (3) time and risk-dependent path planning. The algorithm combines the search for a shortest path with the question: is the detour worth avoiding a possible collision scenario? We evaluate the evasion behavior in different simulation scenarios and the results show that a risk-sensitive agent can avoid 47.3% of the collision scenarios while making a detour of 1.3%. A risk-averse agent avoids up to 97.3% of the collision scenarios with a detour of 39.1%. Thus, an agent's evasive behavior can be controlled actively and risk-dependent using PCMP.},

Then we show that neural networks can be used to solve TSP instances from both, QUBO input and autoencoders’ hidden state representation. We finally generalize the approach and successfully train neural networks to solve arbitrary QUBO problems, sketching means to use neuromorphic hardware as a simulator or an additional co-processor for quantum computing.},

Quantum annealers (QA) are physical devices that aim at this class of problems by exploiting quantum mechanical properties of nature. However, they compete with efficient heuristics and probabilistic or randomised algorithms on classical machines that allow for finding approximate solutions to large NP-complete problems. While first implementations of QA have become commercially available, their practical benefits are far from fully explored. To the best of our knowledge, approximation techniques have not yet received substantial attention. In this paper, we explore how problems’ approximate versions of varying degree can be systematically constructed for quantum annealer programs, and how this influences result quality or the handling of larger problem instances on given set of qubits. We illustrate various approximation techniques on both, simulations and real QA hardware, on different seminal problems, and interpret the results to contribute towards a better understanding of the real-world power and limitations of current-state and future quantum computing.},

Similar to Simulated Annealing it seeks to find a global minimum of a target function. In order to use specialized QA hardware, the problem to be optimized needs to be translated into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. With this paper we investigate whether it is possible to transfer the DTW distance measure into a QUBO formulation. The motivation behind is the hope on an accelerated execution once the QA hardware scales up and the aspiration of gaining benefits due to quantum effects that are not given in the classical calculation. In principle, we find that it is possible to transform DTW into a QUBO formulation suitable for executing on QA hardware. Also, the algorithm returns not only the minimum total distance between two sequences, but also the corresponding warping path. However, there are several difficulties that make a manual intervention necessary.},

In this work we show, however, that under certain conditions swarms also pose Nash equilibria when interpreting the agents’ given task as multi-player game. We show that these conditions can be achieved by altering the area size (while allowing individual action choices) in a setting known from literature. We conclude that aside from offering valuable benefits to rational agents, swarms may also form due to pressuring deviants from swarming behavior into joining the swarm as is typical for Nash equilibria in social dilemmas.},

Taking into account that a person’s expectation is an important aspect of the perception of space, we exploit the theory of Bayesian Surprise to robustly model expectation and thus surprise in the context of building structures. We use Isovist Analysis, which is a popular space syntax technique, to turn qualitative object attributes into quantitative environmental information. Since isovists are location-specific patterns of visibility, a sequence of isovists describes the spatial perception during a movement along multiple points in space. We then use Bayesian Surprise in a feature space consisting of these isovist readings. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach, we take snapshots of an agent’s local environment to provide a short list of images that characterize a traversed trajectory through a 2D indoor environment. Those fingerprints represent surprising regions of a tour, characterize the traversed map and enable indoor LBS to focus more on important regions. Given this idea, we propose to use surprise as a new dimension of context in indoor location-based services (LBS). Agents of LBS, such as mobile robots or non-player characters in computer games, may use the context surprise to focus more on important regions of a map for a better use or understanding of the floor plan.},

For this purpose, we propose a feedback system that combines operations data with development data in order to trace anomalies occurring in production back to their root cause by defining patterns, detecting anomalous behavior, and generating feedback that is transferred back into the development process. To this end, we utilize two different unsupervised machine learning techniques, the k-means clustering and the archetypal analysis, to describe the data set and use the results as a basis to characterize the behavior of new data points as either normal or anomalous. The feedback system was tested and evaluated using real data produced by an application that is currently developed within a large, industrial company and serves as a link to support the loop of continuous planning, development, deployment, monitoring, and feedback.},

Decentralized control offers better scalability and robustness but requires mechanisms to coordinate on joint tasks and to avoid conflicts. Common approaches to learn decentralized policies for cooperative MAS suffer from non-stationarity and lacking credit assignment, which can lead to unstable and uncoordinated behavior in complex environments. In this paper, we propose Strong Emergent Policy approximation (STEP), a scalable approach to learn strong decentralized policies for cooperative MAS with a distributed variant of policy iteration. For that, we use function approximation to learn from action recommendations of a decentralized multi-agent planning algorithm. STEP combines decentralized multi-agent planning with centralized learning, only requiring a generative model for distributed black box optimization. We experimentally evaluate STEP in two challenging and stochastic domains with large state and joint action spaces and show that STEP is able to learn stronger policies than standard multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, when combining multi-agent open-loop planning with centralized function approximation. The learned policies can be reintegrated into the multi-agent planning process to further improve performance.},

We propose Neural Gas Dynamic Path Planning (NGDPP), a novel algorithm that continuously provides a valid path between two points inside an environment that transforms in an unpredictable manner.

The algorithm incorporates several techniques: Neural Gas, a dynamic discretization method; the A* Algorithm, a path planning algorithm for graphs; and the Potential Field method, which facilitates the avoidance of collisions. We empirically evaluate the proposed algorithm under various aspects providing performance information and guidance about situations and applications benefiting from the algorithm. The evaluation reveals that NGDPP is a solid algorithm for path planning in dynamic environments. Yet, the algorithm is based on heuristic information, i.e. a optimal result in term of the path length cannot be guaranteed.},

These models consist of several planes describing the spatial structure of selected features. Those SLM can directly be used for deep reinforcement learning tasks. However, detecting anomalies in such SLM poses two major challenges: the state space explosion in such settings and the spatial relations between the features. In this paper, we present a method for anomaly detection in SLM which solves both challenges by first extracting significant sub-patterns from training data and storing them in a dictionary. Afterwards, the entries of this dictionary are used for reconstructing SLM, which have to be validated. The resulting covering rate is an indicator for the (ab)normality of the given SLM. We show the applicability of our approach for a simple multi-agent scenario, and more complex smart factory scenarios with autonomous agents.},

By tracing back anomalies to its actual trigger, recurrent misbehavior can be eliminated, which improves the system's future performance. In self-organizing industrial systems (SOIS), however, where the system adapts its behavior to the current circumstances and requests, new challenges arise for RCA. For example, the system decides dynamically at runtime how to route the work-pieces through the factory. This high degree of freedom of the system causes a state space explosion, which makes it difficult to formalize explicit connections. In addition, there are new dependency relationships resulting from the online decision making process and its influencing factors, which have to be taken into account for RCA. Accordingly, in this paper, we present first of all a taxonomy of possible root causes in such SOIS. Thereby, we focus in particular on possible error sources resulting from the online decision making process. Based on this, corresponding backtracking approaches are presented, whereby automatable and non-automatable procedures are distinguished. The latter becomes relevant in case that a component of the online decision making system is not evaluable automatably due to the state space explosion. To trace back anomalies anyway, we propose here a visual analytics solution. A corresponding proof of concept which implements the necessary functions for an expert-based assessment is presented in this paper.},

This can be done by simulating how the agent’s actions affect the environment and how it evolves independently of the agent. For this simulation, a model of the environment is needed. However, the creation of this model might be labor-intensive and it might be computational complex to evaluate during simulation. That is why, we suggest to equip an intelligent agent with a learned intuition about the dynamics of its environment by utilizing the concept of intuitive physics. To demonstrate our approach, we used an agent that can freely move in a two dimensional floor plan. It has to collect moving targets while avoiding the collision with static and dynamic obstacles. In order to do so, the agent plans its actions up to a defined planning horizon. The performance of our agent, which intuitively estimates the dynamics of its surrounding objects based on artificial neural networks, is compared to an agent which has a physically exact model of the world and one that acts randomly. The evaluation shows comparatively good results for the intuition based agent considering it uses only a quarter of the computation time in comparison to the agent with a physically exact model.},

Such robots are able to perform various tasks in buildings using a wide array of sensors to perceive their surroundings. A connected area of research which forms the basis for a deeper understanding of these perceptions is the numerical representation of visual perception of space. Different structures in buildings like rooms, hallways and doorways form different, corresponding patterns in these representations. Thanks to recent advances in the field of deep learning with neural networks, it now seems possible to explore the idea of automatically learning these recurring structures using machine learning techniques. Combining these topics will enable the creation of new and better location-based services which have a deep awareness of their surroundings. This paper presents a framework to create a data set containing 2D isovist measures calculated along geospatial trajectories that traverse a 3D simulation environment. Furthermore, we show that these isovist measures do reflect the recurring structures found in buildings and the recurring patterns are encoded in a way that unsupervised machine learning is able to identify meaningful structures like rooms, hallways and doorways. These labeled data sets can further be used for neural network based supervised learning. The models generated this way do generalize and are able to identify structures in different environments.},

Accordingly, analysing anomalies in such a huge solution space becomes more challenging. In this paper, we present a root cause analysis (RCA) approach for finding the root cause of global anomalous events which handles this state space explosion in SOIS. To do so, the dependencies between path usage and external factors like available machines and demanded tasks are subdivided into several sub-dependencies. In addition, we propose for one of these sub-dependencies a heuristical description which avoids the enormous computational effort for modeling the dependency exactly.

abstract = {Mutual usage of vehicles as well as car sharing became more and more attractive during the last years. Especially in urban environments with limited parking possibilities and a higher risk for traffic jams, car rentals and sharing services may save time and money. But when renting a vehicle it could already be damaged (e.g., scratches or bumps inflicted by a previous user) without the damage being perceived by the service provider. In order to address such problems, we present an automated, motion-based system for impact detection, that facilitates a common smartphone as a sensor platform. The system is capable of detecting the impact segment and the point of time of an impact event on a vehicle's surface, as well as its direction of origin. With this additional specific knowledge, it may be possible to reconstruct the circumstances of an impact event, e.g., to prove possible innocence of a service's customer.},

abstract = {Today’s omnipresence of smartphones enables the development of systems detecting hazardous situations and collisions in road traffic as well as recognizing and predicting individual driving behavior. This is accelerated by comprehensive equipment of sensors as well as the availability of mobile data transmission networks. Commonly, they rely on motion sensors in combination with frequency analysis and distance algorithms, e.g., dynamic time warping. Moreover, they also use audio and video features for support. Despite a whole range of work in the area of analyzing vehicle’s signals and to the best of our knowledge, there is no reliable procedure for nuanced collision detection in combination with a smartphone as a sensor platform known to us. A segmented detection of collisions itself would be of great value, e.g., in order to relief customers of a car-sharing or car rental service. After a short introduction of related work, we frame the underlying problem of this paper and present our concept for a nuanced collision detection on specific segments of a parked RC-vehicle under the usage of a static-placed smartphone as the only sensor platform. Therefore, we want to create acceleration signal patterns during an offline phase by analyzing recorded sensor data for impacting pushes on specific vehicle segments in x-,y-, and z-direction. Our work, based on repeated collisions with a RC-vehicle, might function as a proof of concept which may be applied to real vehicles later on.},

With this paper, we propose to organize sets of alternative routes by employing archetypal analysis on a feature space representation of routes and show results in which a set of hundreds of routes between the same start and end point has been compressed to only a few obviously different archetypal routes. Additionally, the framework allows for comparing routes with archetypes and with each other. This comparison does not reveal spatial similarity alone, but rather a measure of routes' similarity representing their inherent semantic character.},

The purpose of TSA routing is to reduce the travel time by choosing a route that is possibly longer than the shortest one but has less red lights. Whereas GLOSA and RLDA are quite easy to implement from a scientific point of view, TSA routing presents a certain challenge: first of all, TSA routing necessitates predictions on future signal states on a wider look in the future than GLOSA and RLDA, a possible reason why this field of research still seems rather unexplored. Second, there are still many unresolved issues, such as the inadequacy of graphs for TSA-routing, or proper traffic load estimations. In this paper, we present a fully functioning model for TSA routing on the basis of our forgoing research on the prediction of future signal states and address the question of practical usability by evaluating our model under realistic conditions. We analyze, among other things, the impact of partial knowledge on traffic light's future signal states and the impact of different traffic loads on TSA routes by means of a test field in Munich, Germany. We describe necessary modifications of the underlying transportation network's graph structure and shortest path routing algorithm to allow routing under consideration of future signal states of traffic lights. We show that, albeit there are many erratic aspects in traffic and signal states, TSA routing still reaches a significant travel time gain over usual routing in our test field.},

abstract = {Currently navigation in indoor scenarios enjoys a highly increasing popularity. Besides that, there are numerous applications that utilize alternatives to a particular path. Think of a navigation system that proposes a mall's visitor three different routes: the fastest, a route passing restaurants, and a route traversing shops. Thus, the visitor is able to choose a route by personal preference or experience. Further users of alternative routes can be fire fighters, mobile robots, or nonplayer characters in video games. In contrast to navigation in road networks, there are several challenges to solve in indoor scenarios. First, the creation of alternative routes is not much discussed in literature. Second, due to the high degree of freedom there is a large number of alternative routes possible regarding a reference path. Third, there is no proper understanding of how to measure the meaningfulness or quality of an alternative route. This paper is a step towards the evaluation of alternative routes in indoor navigation scenarios and has got two main contributions. First, we propose to use the term congestion probability as a first common understanding to estimate the meaningfulness of alternative routes inside buildings. Most of the indoor use cases are looking for routes that either seek or avoid crowded areas - at least as one of multiple criteria. Additionally, we propose to score alternative routes based on a local and a global perception. The paper's second contribution is an algorithm that scores a set of alternative routes based on an ordinary floor plan. Thus, it compares a formerly non-valuated set of routes and creates a ranking regarding the congestion probability. Basically, the algorithm is based on the assumption that points on a map, that are frequently located on shortest paths, will also be frequently traversed. Due to the lack of appropriate data sets we discuss the algorithm's results in detail by means of four different indoor scenarios.},

As an alternative to radio-based localization methods, in 2011, we introduced MoVIPS (Mobile Visual Indoor Positioning System), which is based on the idea to extract visual feature points from a query image and compare them to those of previously collected geo-referenced images. The general feasibility of positioning by SURF points on a conventional smartphone was already shown in our previous work. However, the system still faced several shortcomings concerning real-world usage such as request times being too high and distance estimation being unreliable because of the employed estimation method not being rotation invariant. In this paper, three extensions are presented that improve the practical applicability of MoVIPS. To speed up request times, both a dead reckoning approach (based on step counting using the accelerometer) and an orientation estimation (based on the smartphones compass) are introduced to filter relevant images from the database and thus to reduce the amount of images to compare the query image to. Furthermore, the vectors of the SURF points are quantized. For this purpose, clusters are calculated from all SURF points from the database. As a result, each image can be represented by a histogram of cluster frequencies, which can be compared with each other a lot more efficiently. The third extension is an improvement of the distance estimation method, which uses the matched feature points of an image to perform a perspective transformation and to determine the actual position with the aid of the transformation matrix.},

Imagine, for example, a complicated building like an airport, where passengers can consult a computer terminal to get navigation advices to a desired goal. By scanning the boarding card the calculation of alternatives can be made context-sensitive. Based on gender, amount of time, or shopping preferences, for example, the terminal can display different routes regarding floors traversed, or shops and restaurants passed. Furthermore, the building operator can control the presentation of alternatives in order to influence visitor flows in real time. Therefore, we propose to use the topological concept of homotopy in order to decide if two routes should be considered equivalent or alternative. Basically, the homotopy relation identifies equivalence classes. We propose that a representative of an equivalence class is an alternative regarding another equivalence class. We concatenate the two routes in question and thus, create a polygon. If there is an obstacle inside, the routes are non-homotopic and we consider them as proper alternatives. For this situation, we propose two fundamentally different approaches that are able to find alternative routes with respect to homotopy. The input is a building plan in form of an occupancy grid. Bitmaps allow for fast calculation of the homotopy relation and can be generated from almost any type of environmental model. The first approach aims for enumerating routes that have to visit a special supporting point. This concatenation of two shortest paths leads to alternatives very fast. The second approach is orthogonal to that in the sense that it generates alternatives roughly ordered by their length. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the approaches’ feasibility based on different metrics in several scenarios.},

One major challenge in these systems is to protect the users' privacy, since users will not contribute data if their privacy is jeopardized. Especially location data needs to be protected if it is likely to reveal information about the users' identities. A common solution is the blinding out approach that creates so-called ban zones in which location data is not published. Thereby, a user's important places, e.g., her home or workplace, can be concealed. However, ban zones of a fixed size are not able to guarantee any particular level of privacy. For instance, a ban zone that is large enough to conceal a user's home in a large city might be too small in a less populated area. For this reason, we propose an approach for dynamic map-based blinding out: The boundaries of our privacy zones, called Silent Zones, are determined in such way that at least k buildings are located within this zone. Thus, our approach adapts to the habitat density and we can guarantee k-anonymity in terms of surrounding buildings. In this paper, we present two new algorithms for creating Silent Zones and evaluate their performance. Our results show that especially in worst case scenarios, i.e., in sparsely populated areas, our approach outperforms standard ban zones and guarantees the specified privacy level.},

Consequently, there exists a plethora of usage scenarios for context-aware applications as well as several approaches for the modeling and management of a user’s context information, many of which focus on the efficient and scalable distribution of the latter. With the ongoing rise of smartphones as everyday mobile devices and their steadily increasing amount of sensing and communication capabilities, we finally find ourselves at the edge towards a widespread usage of these techniques. However, apart from technical issues such as how to reliably determine a user’s current context, privacy still remains a crucial factor for these systems’ acceptance rate. Therefore, inspired by earlier works on privacy in context-aware computing and the authors’ beliefs in the necessity to put users in control, this paper presents a novel approach for modeling and managing a mobile user’s context information in a user-centric and privacy-preserving way. To this end, this work’s contribution is twofold: First, based on widely recognized requirements for privacy in context-aware applications, we propose a privacy-centric context model which allows for an intuitive and context-dependent definition of a user’s privacy preferences, directly integrating privacy aspects into the context model itself. Second, we present a generic and flexible architecture for the management and distribution of context information in a privacy-preserving way fit for a multitude of different usage scenarios.},

abstract = {Due to the immense dissemination of low-cost GPS receivers built into mobile devices, an impressive use of location-based services has been achieved in recent years. A popular application is navigation in road networks in conjunction with the presentation of alternative routes that allows users a choice according to their own preferences or experiences. Route finding in complex environments differs from that in road networks mainly due to the fact that a user can move almost in all directions. Examples include pedestrians in airports, hospitals, exhibition halls, or parks, mobile robots in industrial facilities or warehouses, as well as non-player characters in computer games. In these scenarios the provision of alternative routes is useful, too, for example, to enable personalized navigation, to avoid jams proactively, or to carry out tactical movements. This thesis presents approaches which deal with the topic of alternative routes in complex environments at different thematic levels. This includes the calculation of alternative routes in open space, the comparison of geospatial trajectories, and the identification of structures in buildings. First, alternative routes in complex environments are defined using the topological concept of homotopy, so that two routes can be considered alternative if they pass obstacles differently. For this purpose an effcient approximation of the homotopy test is presented together with the implementation of two algorithms for the calculation of such routes. Subsequently a structured presentation of existing quality metrics for alternative routes and alternative graphs in road networks takes place, whereupon the transferability of these approaches into complex environments is discussed. Second, approaches for the direct comparison of routes are presented. On the one hand, a scoring of routes is suggested based on the assumption that routes, which often lie on a shortest paths, are also often traversed. On the other hand, a system is presented that allows the calculation of archetypal routes by extracting the most extreme instances from a set of routes. Corresponding to this, the archetypal distance is defined, with which routes can be compared not only geometrically but in a multi-dimensional feature space. Third, the quantitative analysis of the visual perception of space is incorporated into the context of alternative routes. Based on the idea of so-called Isovists, a user's local environment is approximated in order to calculate alternative routes, to annotate them, and to determine structures in buildings. In summary, the contributions of this thesis can be understood in their entirety as a toolbox which can be used by other location-based services.},
