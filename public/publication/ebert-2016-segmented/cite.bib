 abstract = {Mutual usage of vehicles as well as car sharing became more and more attractive during the last years. Especially in urban environments with limited parking possibilities and a higher risk for traffic jams, car rentals and sharing services may save time and money. But when renting a vehicle it could already be damaged (e.g., scratches or bumps inflicted by a previous user) without the damage being perceived by the service provider. In order to address such problems, we present an automated, motion-based system for impact detection, that facilitates a common smartphone as a sensor platform. The system is capable of detecting the impact segment and the point of time of an impact event on a vehicle's surface, as well as its direction of origin. With this additional specific knowledge, it may be possible to reconstruct the circumstances of an impact event, e.g., to prove possible innocence of a service's customer.},
