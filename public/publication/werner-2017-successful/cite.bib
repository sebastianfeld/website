 abstract = {Currently, we experience a growing number of highly sophisticated digital services in virtually every domain of our lives. Tightly coupled to this observation is the appearance of Big Data and consequently the need for Data Science. When trying to transform data into value, communication is key. However, communication can easily get ambiguous and may threat success by misunderstandings. Thus, this article reviews the (communication) model of Data Science and maps the ten Vâ€™s of Big Data to this model. Finally, we propose four top skills that each and every data science group needs to have to operate successfully.},
