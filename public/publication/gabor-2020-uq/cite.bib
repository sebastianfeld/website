 abstract = {Quantum Annealing is an algorithm for solving instances of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) that is implemented in hardware utilizing quantum effects to quickly find approximate solutions. However, QUBO can obviously also be solved by any classical optimization technique, for which various implementations exist. The UQ platform provides a unified interface to various means of solving QUBO that allows for a seamless switch between classical and quantum methods while implementing features such as load and user management.},
